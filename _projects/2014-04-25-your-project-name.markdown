Face Recognition using K-Nearest Neighbors

Packages to Install:-

Python 2.7

Numpy, SciPy

Mathplotlib

OpenCV Python

KNN classifier is best suited for classifying persons based on
their images due to its lesser execution time and better
accuracy than other commonly used methods which include
Hidden Markov Model and Kernel method. Although methods
like SVM and Adaboost algorithms are proved to be more
accurate than KNN classifier, KNN classifier has a faster
execution time and is dominant than SVM.
The simplest classification scheme is a nearest neighbor
classification in the image space. Under this scheme an image
in the test set is recognized by assigning to it the label of the
closest point in the learning set, where distance are measured
in image space.
The Euclidean distance metric is often chosen to
determine the closeness between the data points in KNN. A
distance is assigned between all pixels in a dataset. Distance is
defined as the Euclidean distance between two pixels.
This Euclidean distance is by default in a KNN classifier. But
the distance between two features can be measured based on
one of the distance cosine and correlation.
