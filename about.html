            <h4>More About Our Agency.</h4>
            <p>**YANTRIX** is *the official technical club* of **PANJAB UNIVERSITY SSG REGIONAL CENTRE**.As a part of the *Students' Technical Activities Body*, we aim to provide a gateway for the people in our institute to join the coding community. We create a platform which allows students to gain assistance and mentorship to enhance their coding ability. Under the aegis of *STAB*, we carry forward our vision of propagating the enthusiasm for coding in our institute and especially amongst freshmen. We believe that every student here at **YANTRIX** should have an opportunity to learn how to ***code*** and develop a *passion* for it. The secret of getting ahead is getting started and we aim to provide every student with the right start.


 

**“*The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can     swim.*”**

**“*Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer.  There are three, of course:       laziness, impatience, and hubris.*”**

**“*OPENSOURCE” is a simple word for common person but it is a whole world for the         programmer*.**

**“*Don’t worry if it doesn’t work right.  If everything did, you’d be out of a job.*”**

**“*First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.*”**






**What do we do?**

We conduct sessions and workshops, hold lectures and talks, and even host coding competitions and hackathons. There is something for everyone. Whether you want to learn, participate in hackathons and win big prizes, you can do it all here. We have a list of events planned up for this year. Keep watching this space to know more.

            <p>Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>
