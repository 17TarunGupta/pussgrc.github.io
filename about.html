            <h4>More About Our YANTRIX</h4>
            <p>YANTRIX is the official technical club of PANJAB UNIVERSITY SSG REGIONAL CENTRE.</p>
            <p>As a part of the Students' Technical Activities Body, we aim to provide a gateway for the people in our institute to join the coding community.</p>
            <p> We create a platform which allows students to gain assistance and mentorship to enhance their coding ability.
                Under the aegis of STAB, we carry forward our vision of propagating the enthusiasm for coding in our institute and especially amongst freshmen.</p>
            <p>We believe that every student here at YANTRIX should have an opportunity to learn how to code and develop a passion for it.
                The secret of getting ahead is getting started and we aim to provide every student with the right start.</p>
